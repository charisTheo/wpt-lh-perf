# WPT & LH Perf Tool Set-up 📱
This is a tool to automate mobile performance testing via [**WebPageTest**] (https://www.webpagetest.org/) and [**Lighthouse**] (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).


## What do you need?
* **WebPagetest API Key**. Later it is explained how to get one.
* **Google account** (e.g. @gmail.com) to fork the Google Sheets tracker and the Data Studio dashboard.


## Do you want to give it a try? 😁

### #1 Set-up the Google Sheets tracker
> Use your Google account to make a copy of the template [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k8Qr-d2Ze_51975a3t2TcV4jPxrZBWOlCxILBQzNTMw/copy) and follow the instructions in the 'How to Use' tab.

> I would recommend a single person to be the owner and editor of the file. Also remember to keep test settings consistent along time.

### #2 Create the dashboard (optional)
> Once the data has populated the 'Tests' tab for a few days, you can make a copy of the Data Studio template [here] (???????) and link it to your tracker.

> Instructions?????

> Share the dashboard with the team!
