# WPT & LH Perf Tool Set-up 📱
This is a tool to automate mobile performance testing via <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank">WebPageTest</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>.


## What do you need?
* **WebPagetest API Key**. Later it is explained how to get one.
* **Google account** (e.g. @gmail.com) to fork the Google Sheets tracker and the Data Studio dashboard.


## Do you want to give it a try? 😁

### #1 Set-up the Google Sheets tracker
> Use your Google account to make a copy of the template <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k8Qr-d2Ze_51975a3t2TcV4jPxrZBWOlCxILBQzNTMw/copy" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the instructions in the 'How to Use' tab.
<br /><br />
> Remember to keep test settings consistent along time. I would even recommend a single person to be the owner and editor of the file. This will be the source of the data and this shoud not be modified by others.

### #2 Create the dashboard (optional)
> Once the data has populated the 'Tests' tab for a few days, you can make a copy of the Data Studio template <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/17eCmvvfV62TI9UhM9t-QmX5ASyE2COkm/page/VgD/preview" target="_blank">here</a> and link it to your tracker by creating a new data source and linking it to Google Sheets.
<br /><br />
> Share the dashboard with the rest of the team!


## Credits 🙏
Thanks **@Antoinebr** for the tracker!
